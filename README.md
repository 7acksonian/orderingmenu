Ordering Menu using Pysimplegui by Jackson
This is the code used for an example ordering application. It has three different categories: entrees, sides, and drinks. Pysimplegui was used to make a user inteface. Classes were implemented to store the ordered values, and a for loop was implemented to add up the ordered items.
